2. Open the file "content.js" if want to change any setting
3. Open your browser extensions page

## Permissions used
* clipboardWrite
* notifications

## Usage
Hold shift and move the cursor to highligh a element and click to copy to clipboard

*important: if the setting "specialTags" has a property for link tags (a) and you click a link a phone number or email that is link too, the href (if available) will be copied. if you want to copy it anyways, maybe try selecting the outer element instead of the text... *

## Settings
_now, only settings on file are availble, a dedicated page may come later_


Open the file "content.js" edit what you need, all of them have a description.

These are the settings that you will find on the file:

```js
/**
 * @description change settings here
 * options page may come later...
 */
const config = {

    /**
     * @description notification after copying
     * 
     * @param {Boolean} enable      enable/disable (true/false)
     * @param {Number}  hideAfterMs hide notifiction after XXmilliseconds
     * set to -1 to not hide
     * 
     * may only work in secure pages/https, not in http/without SSL
     */
    notification:{
        enable: false,
        hideAfterMs: 2000,

    },

    /**
     * @description Enable key to start/stop listening the mouse
     * false -> always listening
     * true  -> listen only when key is held down (recommended)
     * 
     * if disabled, may interfere with navigation, links might not
     * work properly.
     *
     *
     * IMPORTANT: clicking on ANYTHING will copy to clipboard, if
     * you click in text and want to paste in a input field,
     * whatever is in the input will OVERWRITE the clipboard.
     * I only recommend if you are using to copy from a page to
     * another software, like notepad for example.
